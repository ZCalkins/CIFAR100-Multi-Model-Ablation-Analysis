# Model Performance and Tuning Analysis on CIFAR (MPTAC)

The aim of this project is to evaluate and delineate the robustness, scalability, and generalization capabilities of three model architectures: CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), ViTs (Vision Transformers) and gMLPs (Gated Multi-Layer Perceptrons) on data with varying levels of complexity by using CIFAR10 (10 classes) and CIFAR100 (100 classes).
