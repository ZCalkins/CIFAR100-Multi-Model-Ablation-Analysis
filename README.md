# Model Performance and Tuning Analysis on CIFAR

The aim of this project is to evaluate and further assess the robustness, scalability, and generalization capabilities of three model architectures: CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), ViTs (Vision Transformers) and gMLPs (Gated Multi-Layer Perceptrons) by performing rigorous abaltion analyses and hyperparameter tuning on both the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets.
