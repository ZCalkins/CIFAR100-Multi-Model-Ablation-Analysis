# Model Performance and Tuning Analysis on CIFAR

This repository contains the code and experiments for evaluating the tuning, scalability, generalization and reliability of three different deep learning model architectures (CNN, gMLP, and ViT) on the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets. The project includes hyperparameter tuning, core feature ablation, and advanced feature ablation studies.
